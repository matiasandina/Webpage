I have not made new year resolutions, I made [art](https://matiasandina.netlify.app/2021/01/art-in-a-new-year/). I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my `/Project` folder during most of 2020: **lifeviz**.

The goal of [lifeviz](https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz) is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post [‘The Tail End’ by WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html). I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present. On the activities tab, users can display the remaining activity counts for things they could represent using emojis.

This is an example of what it can do:

### Why I made this

The idea is to produce reflection and general introspection about our time on Earth. Actually visualizing the number of remaining days/burgers/hugs, can be a powerful tool to do so. Check [lifeviz here](https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz).

As I briefly mentioned, this app has been created using Shiny and R. I have left all the details out of this post, but you might be interested.

### My life

I have used the app to scratch my own itch, so this is my current status. If I live 90 years, these are the years past (gray), present (red) and left (unfilled).

I think this one is more actionable, gotta make those weeks count!

### Activities

I try to meditate once a day[^maybe]. If I do so for the rest of my life, that's a hell lot of meditation.

On the weekends, I am almost certain to get something tasty, probably with a capuccino ☕ and a book 📖. Let's say I do this only once per weekend, let's call it "Saturday Bakery Breakfast"

### The goal

I hope using this app may help you  appreciate the uniqueness of each of the moments we take for granted. I hope it makes you present, wherever, whenever you are. Enjoy.


[^maybe]: It's an aspirational goal, maybe someday I will get there.
